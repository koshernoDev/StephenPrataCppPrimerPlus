Consider the following class declaration:
class Cow {
char name[20];
char * hobby;
double weight;
public:
Cow();
Cow(const char * nm, const char * ho, double wt);
Cow(const Cow c&);
~Cow();
Cow & operator=(const Cow & c);
void ShowCow() const; // display all cow data
};
Provide the implementation for this class and write a short program that uses all the
member functions.
