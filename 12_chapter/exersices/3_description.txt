Rewrite the Stock class, as described in Listings 10.7 and 10.8 in Chapter 10, so that it
uses dynamically allocated memory directly instead of using string class objects to hold
the stock names. Also, replace the show() member function with an overloaded
operator<<() definition. Test the new definition program in Listing 10.9.
