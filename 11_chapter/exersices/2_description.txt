Modify the Vector class header and implementation files (Listings 11.13 and 11.14) so
that the magnitude and angle are no longer stored as data components. Instead, they
should be calculated on demand when the magval() and angval() methods are called.
You should leave the public interface unchanged (the same public methods with the
same arguments), but alter the private section, including some of the private method,
and the method implementations. Test the modified version with Listing 11.15, which
should be left unchanged because the public interface of the Vector class is unchanged.
