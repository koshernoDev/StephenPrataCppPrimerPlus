Modify Listing 11.15 so that it writes the successive locations of the random walker in a
file. Label each position with the step number. Also have the program write the initial
conditions (target distance and step size) and the summarized results to the file. The file
contents might look like this:
Target Distance: 100, Step Size: 20
0: (x,y) = (0, 0)
1: (x,y) = (-11.4715, 16.383)
2: (x,y) = (-8.68807, -3.42232)
...
26: (x,y) = (42.2919, -78.2594)
27: (x,y) = (58.6749, -89.7309)
After 27 steps, the subject has the following location:
(x,y) = (58.6749, -89.7309)
or
(m,a) = (107.212, -56.8194)
Average outward distance per step = 3.97081
