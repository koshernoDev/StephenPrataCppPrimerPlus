Rewrite the Stonewt class (Listings 11.16 and 11.17) so that it has a state member that
governs whether the object is interpreted in stone form, integer pounds form, or float-
ing-point pounds form. Overload the << operator to replace the show_stn() and
show_lbs() methods. Overload the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operators
so that one can add, subtract, and multiply Stonewt values. Test your class with a short
program that uses all the class methods and friends.
