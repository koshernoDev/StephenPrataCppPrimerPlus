Rewrite the Stonewt class (Listings 11.16 and 11.17) so that it overloads all six relational
operators. The operators should compare the pounds members and return a type bool
value. Write a program that declares an array of six Stonewt objects and initializes the
first three objects in the array declaration. Then it should use a loop to read in values
used to set the remaining three array elements. Then it should report the smallest ele-
ment, the largest element, and how many elements are greater or equal to 11 stone. (The
simplest approach is to create a Stonewt object initialized to 11 stone and to compare
the other objects with that object.)
