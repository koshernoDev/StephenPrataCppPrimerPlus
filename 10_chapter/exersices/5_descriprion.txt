Consider the following structure declaration:

struct customer 
{
char fullname[35];
double payment;
};

Write a program that adds and removes customer structures from a stack, represented by
a Stack class declaration. Each time a customer is removed, his or her payment should
be added to a running total, and the running total should be reported. Note: You should
be able to use the Stack class unaltered; just change the typedef declaration so that
Item is type customer instead of unsigned long.
