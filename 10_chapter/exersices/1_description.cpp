Define a class to represent a bank account. Data members should include the depositor’s
name, the account number (use a string), and the balance. Member functions should
allow the following:
• Creating an object and initializing it.
• Displaying the depositor’s name, account number, and balance
• Depositing an amount of money given by an argument
• Withdrawing an amount of money given by an argument
Just show the class declaration, not the method implementations. (Programming
Exercise 1 provides you with an opportunity to write the implementation.)

Provide method definitions for the class described in Review Question 5 and write a
short program that illustrates all the features.
